# Waiter-Tip-Prediction
Tip Prediction Model :
A machine learning model that predicts restaurant tip amounts based on factors like total bill, customer demographics, dining time, and party size. Utilizes regression techniques to analyze tipping behavior and assist in service optimization.

Project Overview:
Objective: To develop a predictive model that estimates the tip amount based on customer and transaction data.

Dataset: Utilized the Seaborn 'tips' dataset, which includes features like total bill, tip, sex, smoker status, day, time, and size.

Techniques: Implemented multiple linear regression using Python's scikit-learn library.

Outcome: Achieved a model that can predict tip amounts with reasonable accuracy, providing insights into factors influencing tipping.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numerical features.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Assessed the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.

Visualization: Included plots to visualize relationships between features and the target variable.

About Dataset:

Key Features

Total Bill: The total cost of the meal.
Tip: The amount left as a tip by the customer.
Sex: The gender of the individual paying the bill.
Smoker: Indicates whether the party includes smokers(Yes) or non-smokers (No).
Day: The day of the week when the dining occurred. (e.g., Sun for Sunday)
Time: Specifies whether the dining experience was during lunch or dinner.
Size: The size of the dining party, representing the number of individuals in the group.
